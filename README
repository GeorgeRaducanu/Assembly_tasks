Task 1
Simple cipher - Ceaser cipher implementatipn in ASM
"label" in program is a for and "sar" is a basic % operation
in rest, the program is simple and the comentaries are quite clear

Task 2.1
For this task I have used the mathematics tric described in the comments.
The idea is to calculate abs(p1.x + p1.y - p2.x - p2.y)
That is the distence

Task 2.2
For this I have used the same idea from 2.1 and extra I iterated with a "for" in the vector

Task 2.3
I iterated in the vector and I wrote 0 in all positions.
With another iteration I check using the mull function in a "while" that the number is a perfect square
If the number is a perfect square I write 1

Task 3
For the Beaufort encryption I decided to use the formula aproach instead of the tabula recta one.
For ease of use the formula is (key(i % len_key) - plain(i)) % 26 + 'A'
This formula is implemented in the program and I consider it to be more effective than the tabula_recta
and it is also more easy to implement it.

Task 4
This task should be done the following. Go through the matrix in spiral order and then add with a[i][j] the character as done in task 1
